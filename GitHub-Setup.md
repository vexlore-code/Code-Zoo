# GitHub Repository Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up a local project and push it to a GitHub repository from scratch.

---

## Full Git Setup and Push Workflow

```bash
# 1. Go to your project folder
cd /path/to/your/project

# 2. Initialize git repo (if not already)
git init

# 3. Add GitHub remote repo URL (replace with your repo URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repo.git

# 4. Stage all files
git add .

# 5. Commit changes with a message
git commit -m "Initial commit"

# 6. Rename local branch to main (optional but recommended)
git branch -M main

# 7. Pull remote changes and allow unrelated histories (handles cases where remote repo isnâ€™t empty)
git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories --no-rebase

# 8. Push local main branch to GitHub and set upstream
git push -u origin main
````

## Important Notes

* Step 7 (`git pull ...`) is important if the remote repo is not empty or already contains files like README, LICENSE, etc.
* If merge conflicts occur after pulling, resolve them by:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
  git push -u origin main
  ```
* For future updates, just use:

  ```bash
  git add .
  git commit -m "Describe your changes"
  git push
  ```

---

## Summary

* Initialize your repo
* Connect to remote GitHub repo
* Commit your files
* Pull remote changes to avoid conflicts
* Push your local changes

---

Feel free to customize the commit messages and repository URL accordingly!
